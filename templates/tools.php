                    <h3>So what does the new record for the lowest level of winter ice actually mean</h3>
                    <p>The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice then thaws every summer,
                        and that process will continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the Arctic
                        continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of the world, it will always be
                        plunged into bitterly cold polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for all kinds of
                        natural reasons, there’s huge variety of the state of the ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a start, it does not automatically follow that a record amount of ice will melt this
                        summer. More important for determining the size of the annual thaw is the state of the
                        weather as the midnight sun approaches and temperatures rise. But over the more than 30
                        years of satellite records, scientists have observed a clear pattern of decline,
                        decade-by-decade.
